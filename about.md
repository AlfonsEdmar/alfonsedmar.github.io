Hi!

I am Alfons, I am a PhD student at Utrecht University in the department of methodology and statistics. I have a background in psychology, but my current interest lies mainly in statistically combining multiple sources of evidence for valid inferences across studies. If it is related to philosophy of science, Bayesian statistics, meta-analysis, or experimental design, I'm probably interested.
